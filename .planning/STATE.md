# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-11)

**Core value:** Surface obscure, high-impact documentary topics backed by competitor data, not guesswork.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Scraping Infrastructure + Data Model

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Scraping Infrastructure + Data Model)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-11 -- Plan 01-01 executed (data models, registry, database)

Progress: [#.........] 11%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 3min
- Total execution time: 0.05 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 1 | 3min | 3min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3min)
- Trend: baseline

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: SQLite chosen over JSON for data storage (research-validated, not close)
- [Roadmap]: 5 phases derived from 18 requirements; Phases 3-4 split topic generation from project init for coherent delivery boundaries
- [Roadmap]: Phase 5 depends on Phase 2 (not Phase 4), enabling parallel execution after Phase 2
- [01-01]: stdlib sqlite3 over sqlite-utils -- zero dependency, Python 3.14 has full UPSERT support
- [01-01]: tags stored as JSON strings in SQLite, deserialized to Python lists on read
- [01-01]: total_views and description nullable on channels -- yt-dlp cannot provide these

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Competitor seed list not defined -- need user input on which 10-15 channels to track before Phase 1 produces useful output
- ~~sqlite-utils Python 3.14 compatibility unverified~~ RESOLVED: using stdlib sqlite3 instead
- yt-dlp Deno requirement for recent versions -- test metadata-only extraction before Plan 01-02 implementation
