## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: SQLite chosen over JSON for data storage (research-validated, not close)
- [Roadmap]: 5 phases derived from 18 requirements; Phases 3-4 split topic generation from project init for coherent delivery boundaries
- [Roadmap]: Phase 5 depends on Phase 2 (not Phase 4), enabling parallel execution after Phase 2

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Competitor seed list not defined -- need user input on which 10-15 channels to track before Phase 1 produces useful output
- sqlite-utils Python 3.14 compatibility unverified -- fallback is stdlib sqlite3
- yt-dlp Deno requirement for recent versions -- test metadata-only extraction before Phase 1 implementation
